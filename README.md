AI Agents Roadmap – Summary
This flowchart outlines the foundational and advanced topics required to build intelligent AI agents. It’s structured into sequential learning modules:

🔵 1. Python Basics
Learn programming essentials:

Data types

Control flow (e.g., if-else, loops)

File input/output

🔵 2. Machine Learning
Understand core ML concepts:

Classification algorithms

Neural networks

Reinforcement learning techniques

🔵 3. API Wrappers
Integrate AI APIs using:

GPT wrappers (e.g., OpenAI SDK)

File I/O handling

Authentication techniques

🔵 4. Prompt Engineering
Master prompt design for LLMs:

Few-shot prompting

Zero-shot prompting (note: typo "Zelc-shot" in image)

Role-based prompting

🔵 5. AI LLM Fundamentals (Labeled “AI AGFs” in image, likely a typo for “LLMs”)
Learn about:

Transformers

Tool usage

Memory handling

🔵 6. AI Agent Frameworks
Explore:

Planning mechanisms

Feedback loops

Orchestration of tasks

🔵 7. AI Agents
Build intelligent agents using:

Tools and external actions

TOM and MCP (likely meant to be ToM – Theory of Mind, and MCP – Multi-Component Planning)

Memory systems

🔵 8. Evaluation & Observability
Ensure agent quality and performance:

Use metrics

Enable logging

Perform stress testing

🤖 Final Output
You become capable of building and deploying cool AI agents!
